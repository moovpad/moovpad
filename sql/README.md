# SQL REFERENCE

## GOALS

- Establish a central repository for SQL related scripts and stored procedures
- Ensure that these resources are as widely applicable as possible with common relational systems
- Utilise best-practice syntax and CI/CD pipeline integration methodologies 
- Incorporate the resources into other repositories where applicable (e.g. Ansible playbooks)

## WHY USE TEMPLATE FILES?

- Modular approach:
    - Produce standardised resources that can be re-used across any application
        - Ansible automated playbook deployments
        - Database system creation as part of application development
        - Enable adherence to SQL best-practices
- Better aligns with CI/CD best-practice approaches
- Stanadardises communication between teams and facilitates more efficient collaboration

## SYSTEMS

- Build these resources to be portable between differrent DBMS platforms (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc)
- Provide references where necessary for specific use cases
- Provide links to resources used in developing these templates, for further research by users
