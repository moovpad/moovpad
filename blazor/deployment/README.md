## DEPLOYMENT - SAMPPLE DOCKER & NGINX CONFIG FILES

The Dockerfile presented within this directory is a tested and validated example for the deployment of a Blazor WASM Standalone project. This file assumes that the solution file (.sln) is placed in the same folder as the project (.csproj) file. Additionally, the 'nginx.conf' files provided here was also tested and validated correct during initial testing. Although other configurations may be possible, the files contained here are essentially the same as those planned for use in the deployment of the MOOVPAD web app image within dockerised containers.

These files are provided only as a public resource for demonstration purposes.
