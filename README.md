## WHO IS INVOLVED WITH THE PROJECT

Work on the MOOVPAD project is currently being undertaken by Dr Ehsan M Hamdy (or EMH to friends), who is a clinical and exercise physiologist, researcher, and an amateur programmer who has been writing code for his own projects for many years but has never worked in an app development role professionally. The goals set by EMH for the initial stage of the project are to develop the underlying framework in parallel with the ongoing work on the science behind the entire project. Once the essentials of the PAPE Framework 1.0 are completed, the plan is to then collaborate with others on enhancing the secondary features of the app suite further. Additionally, the MOOVPAD project is being built upon a foundation of corporate social responsibility principles that underpin all development and future business practices and policies.

## MOOVPAD PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Xamarin projects being developed for mobile deployment form part of a suite of health and fitness apps. These apps will make use of research completed in clinical and exercise physiology, which has led to several patent applications and a new framework of algorithms for assessing performance during exercise and training. I won't go into too much detail here, but suffice it to say that I found a gap in the established science relating to physiologic efficiency. The MOOVPAD project goals are focused on building the tools necessary to help professionals and those training for their own health and fitness to better understand their performance (as opposed to using measures like heart rate in isolation).

## PARTS OF THE PROJECT

Broadly speaking, the dev work initially aims to deliver a suite of apps for desktop and mobile devices running:

    Windows PC
    macOS
    Android
    iOS
    UWP
