## THE PROJECT

Work on the MOOVPAD project is currently being undertaken by Dr Ehsan M Hamdy (or EMH to friends and community), who is a clinical and exercise physiologist, researcher, and an idenependent developer. 

The projects being developed for web, desktop and mobile deployment form part of a suite of health and fitness apps. These apps will make use of research completed in clinical and exercise physiology by EMH, which has led to several patent applications and a new framework of algorithms for assessing performance during exercise and training. 

Without going into too much detail here, suffice it to say that a gap in the established science relating to physiologic efficiency was found. The MOOVPAD project goals are focused on building the tools necessary to help professionals and those training for their own health and fitness to better understand their performance (as opposed to using measures like heart rate in isolation).

Below are alinks to some of the main parts of the Discussion section, which is being used to provide ongoing updates on the project as work progresses.

## DEV LEARNING & TRAINING

Probably the first thing worth mentioning in terms of the MOOVPAD project development is the fact that the learning required to reach this stage has been quite intense (especially when considered alongside a full time work schedule), and that this learning is an ongoing, purposeful focus for the main developer and any future team members. A separate section of Discussions relating to some of this learning has been set up here:

## SCIENTIFIC FRAMEWORK AT THE CORE

It's difficult to understand the real need for, and driving reasons behind, the development of the MOOVPAD auite of apps without considering why the science at their core is so important. So a separate section has been setup in the Discussions to address these topics briefly, and can be found at this link:

## FRONTEND APPS

Building modern applications for multiple audiences (such as general users as well as professionals), across a full range of platforms, has led to MOOVPAD development work being divided into separate project streams and stages for each of these. A thorough look at the work being done to develop these frontend applications can be found here:

## BACKEND INFRASTRUCTURE - GENERAL

Overall strategies, primary system considerations and planning for server-side infrastructure can be found here:

## BACKEND INFRASTRUCTURE - DATA RELATED

Data-related development is one of the most important parts of the MOOVPAD project. This is not just because of the need to ansure security and privacy, but also to enable efficient analytics and AI integration based on a core set of data policies. Information relating to these topics can be found here:

## MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS & INFRASTRUCTURE

Of course the operation of a set of apps like those described here as well as all of the necessary infrastructure will require a set of systems management tools to go with them. Work on developing thesse will be updated here:

## CODE DEVELOPMENT

As the learning, testing and pverall development has continued, there have been opportunities to improve coding strategies and implement new ways for things like workflows and UI rendering, as well as general code refactoring and enhancement for ongoing CI/CD. These topics can be found in the following sections:

## MOOVPAD APP GROWTH PLANNING

Although the current development work on the MOOVPAD project will present a comprehensive set of tools for general and professional users for exercise and health, there are also planned additions to these core functions. Discussion of these will be updated through the section below:

## FURTHER INFO

Please see the Discussion section of this repo for app and server-side devlogs, as well as the blog section of the website (www.moovpad.com/blog) for those interested in the background science, and an archive of the development work between August 2021 and December 2024. 

Any questions can be forwarded to info@moovpad.com or shared in the Discussion section here. 

Please note that the website is only a temporary placeholder while work on the initial web app continues.
