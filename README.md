## THE PROJECT

Work on the MOOVPAD project is currently being undertaken by Dr Ehsan M Hamdy (or EMH to friends and community), who is a clinical and exercise physiologist, researcher, and an idenependent developer. 

The projects being developed for web, desktop and mobile deployment form part of a suite of health and fitness apps. These apps will make use of research completed in clinical and exercise physiology by EMH, which has led to several patent applications and a new framework of algorithms for assessing performance during exercise and training. 

Without going into too much detail here, suffice it to say that a gap in the established science relating to physiologic efficiency was found. The MOOVPAD project goals are focused on building the tools necessary to help professionals and those training for their own health and fitness to better understand their performance (as opposed to using measures like heart rate in isolation).

## FURTHER INFO

Please see the Discussion section of this repo for app and server-side devlogs, as well as the blog section of the website (www.moovpad.com/blog) for those interested in the background science, and an archive of the development work between August 2021 and December 2024. 

Any questions can be forwarded to info@moovpad.com or shared in the Discussion section here. 

Please note that the website is only a temporary placeholder while work on the initial web app continues.
