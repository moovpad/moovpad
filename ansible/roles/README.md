## ANSIBLE PLAYBOOKS - CONFIRMED FUNCTIONAL FOR LOCAL RUN

The Ansible playbooks provided here were tested and validated for local runs on Ubuntu 24.04 Server virtual machines, set up on the latest current Proxmox virtualisation environment. These are written and intended to be run from within the VM's as local runs based on the specific needs of the MOOVPAD project and structure, with the intention to modify these and other similar playbooks for use with Ansible Builder once it is available in final release.
