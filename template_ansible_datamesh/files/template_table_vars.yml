# The purpose of this variables file is to simplify the definition of datamesh object specification,
# making it possible for personnel other than data engineers to more easily communicate system requirements.
# In conjunction with the template SQL object files, these together should standardise datamesh design,
# development and deployment, as well as integrating well within CI/CD pipelines for server-side devsecops.
